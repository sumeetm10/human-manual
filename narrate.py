"""Narration with the free, unmetered voice, and word times for the captions.

edge-tts has no daily cap (Gemini's acted voice manages about six lines a day,
too few for a 10-line script twice a day). It reads everything in one register,
so each line carries its own pace and pitch. edge-tts no longer reports word
boundaries at all, so the word times are measured from the takes by the story
channel's time_words (timing.py) (~0.1 s against hand-marked onsets).
