"""Acted narration: the whole script performed in ONE Gemini TTS take.

edge-tts reads "and then the land just ends" in the same voice as "you set off
from Delhi". Gemini's TTS performs a plain-English direction, but the free tier
allows only about six takes a day - the story channel records one take per
line and runs out after one episode. One take per VIDEO (two a day) fits.

The take is then cut back into lines at its longest pauses (the performer is
told to pause between lines), and every cut is checked: the transcript must
match the script and each line must last a believable time for its words. If
anything is off, narrate.py uses the steady edge-tts voice instead. A video
always gets made; it just is not always acted.
